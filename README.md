non-blockable-AdBlocker-detector
================================

A friendly AdBlocker detector message script which can not be blocked by... AdBlocker (and others)

This is not meant to be used to irritate people, but to get some common sense in them.
Hardcore Adblock users commonly block the 'please consider disabling AdBlocker' messages.
This script keeps displaying these messages even when hardcore AdBlock users block them.
